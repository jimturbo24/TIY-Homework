I thought that Sasha's advice for asking questions was pretty good. Stating what
you've already done and restating the response to a question are techniques that
I have found very useful in my life. Although I see the value in the 15-minute
rule and clearly stating what you need, I have a bad habit of spending entirely
too much time trying to figure out problems or gumming up a question with breaks,
pauses, and redirects that can confuse the person I'm speaking with. Focusing on
these points will be helpful in my future programming career. With respect to
answering questions, I think that the two most important points that she makes
are related, namely being aware of how you make people feel and the language that
you use when answering questions. People who are emotionally turned off by you
don't learn much from you. The language (both verbal and non-verbal) that you use
to respond to a question has a direct affect on a individuals emotional state.
After these two point are understood well, it's always good to share the how and
why of what you know.

I know that the title of this talk was "beyond PEP8", but it might as well have
had the title "Beauty is only PEP8 deep" or something like that. I didn't really understand the router configuration code that he was working with, but his point
was clearly made when he took nice looking PEP8 code and and completely  made it
obsolete by writing simplified, more 'pythonic', code. In the future, I will
strive to write good, clear, code first and then make it look pretty with PEP8
formatting.
